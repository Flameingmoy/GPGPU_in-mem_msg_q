# Project Overview and Use Cases

This project envisions a **GPU-accelerated data processing pipeline** that uses Redis as a message broker and NVIDIA CUDA for parallel computation. Potential use cases include high-speed data analytics, real-time sensor or log processing, AI inference queues, and other parallel workloads. For example, streaming data (like financial ticks or IoT events) could be queued in Redis and processed in parallel on the GPU for low-latency insights. Although we’re building a local development MVP, the architecture can later scale for high throughput and reliability. The focus is on **maximizing speed and throughput**, with Redis providing a fast in-memory queue and CUDA kernels executing work in parallel on the RTX 4070 Ti (CUDA Compute Capability 8.9). We will also consider basic fault tolerance (e.g. reliable queuing, retries) for a robust design.

## Architectural Components

* **Redis Message Queue:** Redis will function as an **in-memory broker/queue**. Its data structures (Lists, Sorted Sets, Streams, Pub/Sub) enable fast message passing.  We can use a Redis List or Stream to enqueue “tasks” (data or work items) and have a worker pop them for GPU processing. Redis Streams provide a durable append-only log (with consumer groups for reliable delivery), while simple lists with RPOPLPUSH can implement reliable FIFO queues. Pub/Sub can signal new data with low latency. For the MVP, a straightforward list-based queue is sufficient, with transactions or ACK patterns added later for reliability.

* **CUDA/GPU Engine:** The core processing uses NVIDIA CUDA on the RTX 4070 Ti GPU (Ada Lovelace, CC 8.9). CUDA kernels will execute tasks in parallel. We will write one or more kernels (e.g. for vector/matrix operations, inference, etc.) and launch them with a grid of thread blocks. Each block can have up to 1024 threads on this GPU. The host code uses the CUDA Runtime API to allocate device memory (`cudaMalloc`), transfer data (`cudaMemcpy` or `cudaMemcpyAsync`), launch kernels (`<<<grid, block>>>` syntax), and retrieve results. We’ll leverage CUDA streams for concurrency so that data transfer and compute can overlap.

* **Host/CPU Component:** A CPU program (e.g. in C/C++ or Python with CUDA bindings) will coordinate Redis and CUDA. It will fetch tasks from Redis, prepare data, launch GPU kernels, and push results or status back to Redis. This component will handle retries, error checking, and flow control. For MVP testing, it can run on the same machine as Redis and the GPU.

## Core Features and MVP Goals

1. **High-Throughput Task Queuing:** Use Redis (in-memory) for low-latency message passing. The system should support enqueuing many tasks quickly and allow the GPU worker to poll/process them continuously. For example, use a Redis List (LPUSH/BRPOP) or Stream to queue work units.

2. **Parallel GPU Computation:** Implement CUDA kernels that process tasks in parallel. For instance, a simple “vector add” kernel might be used as a placeholder (see example below). Kernels should be launched with multiple blocks and threads (e.g. via `VecAdd<<<blocks, threads>>>()`), exploiting the GPU’s many cores.

3. **Asynchronous Execution:** Use CUDA streams to overlap data transfer and computation for maximum throughput. E.g. split work into chunks and on each stream do `cudaMemcpyAsync(…, stream); kernel<<<…, stream>>>; cudaMemcpyAsync(…, stream);` so that transfers on one stream overlap with execution on another.

4. **Reliability and Ordering:** Ensure tasks aren’t lost. In MVP, we can use a simple reliable-queue pattern (RPOPLPUSH) so that if the worker crashes, tasks can be retried. Longer-term, Redis Streams or ACK patterns can guarantee “at least once” delivery.

5. **Local Development and Testing:** The MVP will run on one machine with the RTX 4070 Ti. Setup will include installing CUDA Toolkit (compatible with compute 8.9) and a Redis server. We’ll provide a simple configuration (e.g. config file or environment variables) to point the worker to Redis and set parameters (like block size or number of streams).

6. **Monitoring and Logging:** Even in MVP, include basic logging of queue sizes, processing rates, and any errors. Collect metrics (tasks/sec, GPU utilization) to validate performance goals.

## Redis Message Queue Design

Redis excels at low-latency queues. We can use:

* **Lists (FIFO):** A Redis List can implement a simple queue (LPUSH to enqueue, BRPOP to block-pop). This is straightforward for tasks that just need sequential processing. Example: one Redis key (e.g. “task\_queue”) stores pending tasks as list elements.

* **Sorted Sets (Priority):** If tasks have priorities/timestamps, we could use a Sorted Set where the score is the priority. Consumers poll the lowest-score element first (e.g. ZPOPMIN). This adds complexity, so likely future work.

* **Streams (Advanced):** Redis Streams (since 5.0) are append-only logs with consumer groups, suitable for reliable streaming. They let consumers acknowledge messages and resume from offsets. We might transition to Streams if we need persistence and advanced features.

* **Pub/Sub (Notifications):** We could use Redis Pub/Sub for *notifications* (e.g. “new task available”), but note that Pub/Sub alone doesn’t queue messages if the consumer is offline. It’s best combined with lists/streams for reliability. For MVP, we may skip pub/sub and simply block on BRPOP.

To summarize: for MVP we’ll likely use a **List queue**. Each worker does something like:

```
while (true) {  
  // BRPOP blocks until an item is available or timeout  
  task = redisClient.brpop("task_queue", timeout);  
  if (task) { processTask(task); }  
}  
```

This is simple and high-performance (Redis is in-memory and single-threaded, so very fast for push/pop). For reliability, one pattern is BRPOPLPUSH from “pending” to a processing list, then LREM on success (so tasks aren’t lost on crash). We can also use MULTI/EXEC transactions to ensure atomic moves.

## CUDA/GPU Integration

On the GPU side, we exploit massive parallelism. Key CUDA concepts:

* **Kernels and Threading:** A CUDA *kernel* is a function executed by many threads in parallel. It’s declared with `__global__`. For example, the guide shows:

  ```cpp
  __global__ void VecAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C) {
      int i = threadIdx.x;
      C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
  }
  // ...
  // Launch with N threads in one block:
  VecAdd<<<1, N>>>(A, B, C);
  ```

  Each CUDA thread has a unique ID (`threadIdx`, `blockIdx`) and executes the kernel code on one element. We will design kernels where **each thread processes one or a few data elements** of a task.

* **Grid/Block Dimensions:** Kernels launch with a grid of blocks (`<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>`). Current NVIDIA GPUs allow up to **1024 threads per block**. For example, one might use `threadsPerBlock = 256` and `blocksPerGrid = (N + 255)/256` for N elements. The `blockIdx` and `blockDim` built-ins tell each thread which piece of data to handle. In our design, the host code will compute appropriate grid/block sizes based on data size and hardware constraints.

* **Memory Management:** We allocate memory on the GPU with `cudaMalloc` and free with `cudaFree`. Data transfer between host and GPU uses `cudaMemcpy` (synchronous) or `cudaMemcpyAsync` (asynchronous). For example, to process an array of floats:

  ```cpp
  float *d_A;
  size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
  cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&d_A, size);
  cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  VecAdd<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C);
  cudaMemcpy(h_A, d_A, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  ```

  This pattern (malloc, memcpy, kernel, memcpy back) is standard. We will wrap all CUDA calls with error checks (as shown in NVIDIA’s sample code) for robustness. For large data or streaming, we’ll use `cudaMemcpyAsync` and CUDA streams (below).

* **CUDA Streams and Overlap:** To maximize throughput, we use multiple CUDA streams so that memory copies and kernel executions can overlap. In one stream we might copy chunk0 to GPU and launch kernel0, while in another we simultaneously copy chunk1 or retrieve results. NVIDIA’s guide shows that issuing copies and kernel launches on different streams can overlap operations. In practice, our worker can use a few streams in a loop: enqueue async copy and kernel on stream0, then continue with stream1, etc., and use events (or `cudaStreamSynchronize`) to know when each stream’s work is done.

* **Device Properties (RTX 4070 Ti):** The RTX 4070 Ti (Ada Lovelace architecture) supports Compute Capability 8.9. It has many SMs with 32-wide warps. We should tune block sizes (often multiples of 32 threads) for efficiency. Warps execute in lockstep, so avoiding divergent branches in kernels will help performance (threads in a warp should follow the same path). The GPU has fast shared memory and registers per block; complex kernels can use shared memory for faster data access if needed.

## Implementation Plan (Tasks and Roadmap)

To combine Redis and CUDA, we’ll follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment:** Install CUDA Toolkit (compatible with CC 8.9) and necessary drivers for the RTX 4070 Ti. Install Redis locally. Verify the GPU is recognized (e.g. via `nvidia-smi`).

2. **Basic CUDA Sample:** Write and test a simple CUDA program (e.g. vector addition) on the GPU. Use code like NVIDIA’s sample. Ensure we understand memory transfer and kernel launch syntax. For reference, a minimal example:

   ```cpp
   // Example from NVIDIA guide:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}:contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}
   __global__ void addKernel(float *A, float *B, int N) {
       int i = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
       if (i < N) A[i] += B[i];
   }
   // Host code would do cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy, launch addKernel<<<...>>>, and cudaMemcpy back.
   ```

3. **Redis Queue Prototype:** Write a small program (in C++/Python) that uses Redis to enqueue and dequeue simple tasks (e.g. integer arrays). Verify that pushing and popping tasks works and blocks as expected. For example, use `LPUSH task_queue data` and `BRPOP task_queue`. Test with a trivial CPU-side handler to ensure queue functionality.

4. **GPU-Task Worker Loop:** Implement the main loop: the program blocks on Redis for a task, then when one arrives, it transfers data to GPU, runs a kernel, and returns the result. Initially, use synchronous copies and a simple kernel. E.g. a task might include two float arrays; the worker loads them and adds them on GPU. Confirm end-to-end: push a task into Redis, have worker process it, and verify output.

5. **Asynchronous Overlap:** Replace `cudaMemcpy` with `cudaMemcpyAsync` and launch on a `cudaStream_t`. Introduce multiple streams so the worker can pre-copy the next task while the GPU is working on the current one. This is crucial for throughput. Test that operations overlap by measuring timings (GPU occupancy can be monitored).

6. **Reliability Enhancements:** Implement a “pending” list or transaction so that if the worker crashes after popping a task, that task isn’t lost. For example, use `RPOPLPUSH pending_queue processing_queue`. Only after GPU success do we remove from `processing_queue`. Add simple retry logic if a kernel fails. Eventually consider using Redis Streams or acknowledgment channels for greater reliability.

7. **Benchmark and Tuning:** Measure performance of the MVP (tasks/sec, latency). Try different grid/block sizes, number of streams, and Redis data sizes. Use these insights to adjust parameters. Ensure GPU occupancy is high (fill as many threads/blocks as needed). Profile to find bottlenecks (e.g. whether CPU-Redis or GPU is limiting throughput).

8. **Documentation and Tests:** Write clear documentation (like this design doc). Include sample code snippets and usage instructions. Also create unit tests or scripts to simulate task generation and measure correctness/performance.

9. **Future Extensions:** (Beyond MVP) Plan multi-GPU support, distributed deployment, advanced reliability (Redis clusters, etc.), security, and integration with real data sources or sinks (Kafka, REST API).

## CUDA Reference Guide (Key Snippets and Patterns)

Below are helpful CUDA code patterns and notes drawn from NVIDIA documentation for quick reference:

```cpp
// Kernel definition: each thread adds one element of two arrays (see NVIDIA sample:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49})
__global__ void vecAdd(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
    int i = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) C[i] = A[i] + B[i];
}
```

This uses `__global__` and is launched with `vecAdd<<<blocks, threads>>>(...)`. The `threadIdx` and `blockIdx` built-ins give each thread a unique index.

```cpp
// Host code: allocate and copy data (pattern from NVIDIA sample:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52})
int N = 1024;
size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
float *h_A = (float*)malloc(size), *h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
// (initialize h_A, h_B...)
float *d_A, *d_B;
cudaMalloc(&d_A, size);             // allocate on GPU
cudaMalloc(&d_B, size);
cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);  // copy to GPU
cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
```

Always check errors after each CUDA call. `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` manage device memory, and `cudaMemcpy` moves data. For streams use `cudaMemcpyAsync`.

```cpp
// Kernel launch example (1D blocks)
int threadsPerBlock = 256;
int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
vecAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);
cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Kernel launch failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
}
```

Each block can have up to 1024 threads on our GPU. We calculate a grid to cover all `N` elements. The execution configuration `<<<blocks,threads>>>` may also include shared memory size and stream as additional parameters (e.g. `vecAdd<<<g,b,0,myStream>>>(...)`).

```cpp
// Example: using CUDA streams to overlap memcpy and kernel (from NVIDIA guide:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54})
cudaStream_t stream[2];
cudaStreamCreate(&stream[0]);
cudaStreamCreate(&stream[1]);
size_t chunkSize = size/2;
for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    // Async copy of chunk i
    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_A + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float), h_A + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float),
                    chunkSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream[i]);
    // Launch kernel on same stream
    vecAdd<<<blocksPerGrid/2, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream[i]>>>(d_A + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float),
        d_B + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float), d_C + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float), chunkSize/sizeof(float));
    // Async copy back
    cudaMemcpyAsync(h_C + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float), d_C + i*chunkSize/sizeof(float),
                    chunkSize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream[i]);
}
// After loop, synchronize streams
for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream[i]);
}
```

By using two streams, the copy of chunk 1 overlaps with the kernel of chunk 0. This pattern can be extended to more streams for greater concurrency.

**Summary of CUDA API patterns:**

* Use `cudaMalloc`/`cudaFree` for device memory (with error checks).
* Use `cudaMemcpy` or `cudaMemcpyAsync` to move data (H2D or D2H). For maximal performance, use page-locked (“pinned”) host memory and asynchronous copies.
* Launch kernels with `kernel<<<grid, block>>>(args);`. Each thread computes its own index via `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx`.
* Use `cudaStream_t` and `cudaMemcpyAsync` to overlap transfers and kernels.
* Remember that threads execute in warps of 32; avoid divergent `if` statements within a warp for best efficiency.

With these building blocks and references, we can incrementally implement the system: a Redis-queued task triggers data upload to the RTX 4070 Ti, a CUDA kernel processes it in parallel, and the result is sent back (optionally via Redis) for consumption.
